# The Small Business Employer

The small business
* usually has less than 25 employees
* sole proprietorship or partnership (owned by just one person or family)
* owners make decisions about hiring and firing employees
* a very limited number of locations that are geographically close together

The important point is that basically a very small group of people make all decisions about hiring and firing - usually the owners of the business.
