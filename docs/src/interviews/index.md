# Congratulations, you got an interview

This is fantastic. Youâ€™ve passed initial scrutiny. At this point, the company thinks you are qualified for their job. 

YES. They think you are qualified for the job if you are interviewing. Let that sink in.

Why are you interviewing? You are interviewing because dozens of other people are also qualified. Your job is to sell yourself as the best candidate to hire out of dozens of other candidates.

How can you prepare for your interview?

You need to create elevator pitches!
