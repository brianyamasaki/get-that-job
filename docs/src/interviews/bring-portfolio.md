# Bring a Portfolio to the Interview

When going into an interview, you will have to answer questions that the interviewer asks you. And you can never predict all the questions they will ask, you just have to prepare for anything and everything.

If you bring a portfolio of projects you've done, they are more likely to ask you to describe what you've worked on and tell them about your part in the project. Good job applicants show their best when asking about applicants' projects - usually reducing nervousness even showing excitement and understanding as they describe their projects. Of course, this means you better have a good concise summary as well as a good understanding of the project, but that's easier than guessing the questions that might be asked of you without the porfolio.
