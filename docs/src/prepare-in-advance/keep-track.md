# Keep Track of Stuff You've Done

Every project you've done, every award you've earned, every design you've created, every organization you've joined and every class you've taken are potentially important to show an employer. You're constantly learning, whether it's 

For everything that you're proud of, take pictures of it and maybe even videos of it and store it somewhere safe. If you wrote a report for it, save a copy of it. Saving these in a digital store (like a USB thumb drive or cloud storage service like OneDrive or DropBox) are a cheap and easy way to keep these items. I personally store it on my computer and on multiple disks and servers so I can grab them when I need them.

## Create a Portfolio of Relevant Jobs and Skills
At any job you're applying for, it helps to show how well you can do the job. It's easy to start a project, but showing off an actual working project is a different and more relevant to your employer. 
- If you're a graphic designer, show photos of some of your projects
- If you're a music producer, have snippets of songs you've created
- If you're a programmer, have examples of websites or projects you've worked on
- If you're a photographer, bring examples of photos that you've taken

As an example, I've created a portfolio website of my past jobs and projects that I wanted to put online. I've got past projects that I worked on, with a screen shot gallery as well as short descriptions of what the project did and what I worked on within the project

## Bring Your Portfolio to Interviews
When going into an interview, you will have to answer questions that the interviewer asks you. And you can never predict all the questions they will ask, you just have to prepare for anything and everything.

If you bring a portfolio of projects you've done, they are more likely to ask you to describe what you've worked on and tell them about your part in the project. Good job applicants show their best when asking about applicants' projects - usually reducing nervousness even showing excitement and understanding as they describe their projects. Of course, this means you better have a good concise summary as well as a good understanding of the project, but that's easier than guessing the questions that might be asked of you without the porfolio.
