# Before You Need a Job

You should start preparing for job hunting as soon as you can. Middle School. High School. College. Trade School. Anytime you do anything that you're proud of (or your family is proud of) should be documented and saved for potential use in getting a job. 

- Did you manage the Ski Team in High school? It could show responsibility and leadership if so. 
- Were you on the Constitutional Law debate team? Public speaking and thinking on your feet.- Were you on the Formula Racing Team and manufacture carbon fiber parts? Tenacity, iteration and engineering design
-  Martial Arts instructor with black belt? Tenacity and leadership
