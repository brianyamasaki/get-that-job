# Networking

You've heard the saying "It's not what you know, but it's who you know." This is absolutely true in job hunting.

Spend time getting to know people who might have connections to jobs you are interested in. Join clubs and socialize in professional organizations. 

In general, be social, enjoy being with people and collect business cards as you go.
