# Networking

You've heard the saying "It's not what you know, but it's who you know." This is absolutely true in job hunting.

Spend time getting to know people who might have connections to jobs you are interested in. Join clubs and socialize in professional organizations. 

In general, be kind to everyone, get to know everybody as well as you can, enjoy being with people and collect contact information as you go.
