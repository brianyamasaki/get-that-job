# Goal or Summary Statement is optional


The summary at the top of the resume is commonly suggested but isnâ€™t required unless your experience listed in the resume seems out of line with the actual job you are applying for. In that case, your summary should state what position or type of job that you are applying for. If the resume is properly targeted toward the job and showcasing the skills the employer is hiring for, then the summary is not necessary.
