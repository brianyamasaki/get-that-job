# How to Describe Items in Resumes

Describing your work experience or volunteer experience in just a few sentences is pretty hard to do. 


## Resume Sentences
Sentence strucure in resumes are different from just about anything else you'll ever write. You're trying to be highly descriptive about your skills and experiences in the fewest possible words and still try to make a connection with the reader.
 

Imagine writing your experience as a summer camp counselor:

::: tip First Try for Camp Counselor
I was a counselor at Camp No-name during the summer of 2018. I did the daily Nature Walks where I guided children through various trails in the forest describing the plants and animals. I also provided first aid and friendly advice when needed.

:::

Every sentence starts with "I" making it very repetitive. Since this resume is about one person, we could safely remove all the "I"s.

It's now less repetitive, but verbs like "was" and "did" don't convey action as well as other verbs could. We'd like to use action words like "Guided," "Taught" and "Aided." The first sentence is actually just a job title, meaning it doesn't need to to be a sentence at all.

## Lists are OK

You could create lists of sentences, but it's important to create complete sentences for the list items to thoroughly describe your responsibilities and actions. A person who doesn't know you or what you did is trying to get an idea of what you did during this activity.

Lists **do** improve the ability to quickly scan through the resume, but at the cost of using more space on your page. If your resume page is overly full, then consider switching to a simple paragraph of sentences instead of lists. If your resume page isn't full, lists of sentence items could be the right thing to do.
