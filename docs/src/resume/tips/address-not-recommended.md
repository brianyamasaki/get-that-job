# Your Mailing Address is not Recommended

In the past, it was recommended to use addresses in the title line or footer. Now that email, blogs and resume sites like LinkedIn are commonplace, there is no advantage to using and address. In fact, it can be a disadvantage, since some companies will prefer local candidates over those that must be moved from far away. 

The only time you want to mention your locality is when you can easily commute to the job site you are applying to. You can mention things like “Local to Seattle Metropolitan area” or “In the South Bay Area.” You can skip it all if you’d like.
