# What is a Resume or Curriculum Vitae (CV)?

A resume is simply a listing of things that tell an employer what you know and what you've done in the past. *Curriculum Vitae* is Latin for "course of life" and is essentially the same document.

While it sounds simple, it's very hard to actually write a single page that describes everything about you that somebody would be interested in. That means you have to pick and choose what you put on the resume and what you've learned in your jobs, hobbies and education to best highlight what makes you better than somebody else.

Since every job and every employer are looking for slightly different things in a job applicant, you should create a special resume for every single job you apply to.

The resume you give to a potential employer should fit into a single page. Some recruiters simply ignore the second page, so keep it to one page.

## Create a Master Resume

Since every resume will be slightly different for whatever job you're applying to, you should keep a master resume that has every job, experience, project and hobby with as much description as you can write. This master resume can span as many pages as you'd like.

This master listing keeps all the information on every item and you'll pick and choose which items to copy and paste into each specialized resume. And you'll edit each item to show off exactly what you want to show your potential employer only including enough to fit on a single page.
