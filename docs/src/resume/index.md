# What is a Resume or Curriculum Vitae (CV)?

A resume is simply a listing of things that tell an employer what you know and what you've done in the past. *Curriculum Vitae* is Latin for "course of life" and is essentially the same document.

While it sounds simple, it's very hard to actually write a single page that describes everything about you that somebody would be interested in. That means you have to pick and choose what you put on the resume and what you've learned in your jobs, hobbies and education to best highlight what makes you better than somebody else.

Since every job and every employer are looking for slightly different things in a job applicant, you should create a special resume for every single job you apply to.

The resume you give to a potential employer should fit into a single page. Some recruiters simply ignore the second page, so keep it to one page.

## Get Organized

Plan on searching for a job for at least a couple months and applying to at least half a dozen jobs. That means writing a whole bunch of resumes and cover letters and remembering when you're supposed to get contacted.
