# HR professionals read thousands of items a week, if not more 
You must make your resume easy to read or they may just throw it away. Also know that many recruiters are over the age of 50, when eyes find it harder to read small and low contrast text.
- Use high contrast and larger fonts (no smaller than 10 point)
- You can shrink the margins to squeeze in more words, but tiny margins are not as pleasing to eye for anyone, especially somebody trying to read 50 resumes before lunch.

The HR person is the first person to read your resume and they don't understand most of the engineering speak, tools, techniques or projects. They scan documents for keywords that they are looking for and making sure they are there.

## Make Information Easy To Find

The Recruiter must be able to find your work experience in seconds. Similarly, your education must be quickly found. So it's important to divide your resume into sections that are visually distinct. Recruiters must find what they need within seconds or your resume will be filtered out of the application pool.

Some recommendations for resume sections:

- Relevant Experience
- Education
- Relevant Skills
- Volunteer Experience
- Hobbies

Only use the sections that show you in your best light. For example, don't have a hobbies section if you don't have hobbies that show skills relevant to this job.

::: tip
Your resume **will** eventually get sent to the engineering team, where an engineering manager will decide whether they want to interview you or not, so make sure what’s in your resume is accurate and you can explain any detail in your resume. As an example, do not list COBOL as a computer language you understand if you can’t write a simple program in it. You can say that you understand HTML/CSS even though it was 4 years ago and you haven’t kept up with all the latest changes (of course, be ready to explain that you’re a little out of date).
