# Meet the Job's Requirements

If you want to get past the Artificial Intelligence and Human Resources gatekeepers, you must address the requirements listed in the job listing. 

In the project management job described in [the example above](/resume/job-requirements.html#an-example-job-ad), every sentence and phrase of your resume must be focused on showing the recruiter:
- communication
- managing of schedules
- creation of documents and visual materials
- the capability to understand complex ideas and topics
- leadership, negotiation, teamwork
- ability to be credible and respected

Not only should you showcase those talents listed above, you should use the exact phrases mentioned in the job ad when possible. 

Project Manager can also be called Program Manager and Project Lead, but the AI looking into your document may only be looking for Project Manager. Use their words when you can (but donâ€™t copy and paste entire sentences).
