# Cover Letters

A cover letter is an introduction. You are trying to create an impression of yourself to those who are reading your letter. 

While a resume is a dry listing of facts, your cover letter should show your interests, your passions for doing quality work, your fit with this company and your interest in this company. 

## Know About Your Potential Employer
In fact, the cover letter requires that you actually know something about the company you are applying to. Read their website, know details about what they make and where they make it. Have an idea of their product line. Read the job descriptions in the Careers section to see what jobs they are filling and where they are filling it. If you want to work in the Nashville location, you'd better find out what they make or do in the Nashville location before you apply.

## Making a Cover Letter is Not Easy
Of course, it's hard to fit it all into a half page of text. But if youâ€™re clever, you can do it. And they really want to hire clever people. If it was easy, anybody could do it.

## Cover Letters are not the first thing Recruiters see

Recruiters read your resume first, because if you don't have the basic qualifications, they don't want to waste their time reading your cover letter. This simple fact implies the following:

- You can refer to items in your resume very briefly

## Similar to your resume
- Use keywords to get past the text scanning
- Make sure your letter [gets to the point quickly and is readable](/common-ideas/recruiters-are-busy)
