# Speed Dating

Imagine you are courting a person you want to date with this letter. That dating target wants to know that this isn't a form letter, that you actually know who he/she is. 

Let's pretend the person you are trying to court is named Casey.
- Casey wants to know how well you match with his/her needs
- Casey wants to know how much you appreciate being with him/her
- Casey wants to know that you will be faithful to him/her for an extended time. 

Sounds similar to to a company hiring somebody to work for them, doesn't it.

Tell how much you enjoyed a project. What you learned. How deeply you are connected to your team. How impressed you were. How something changed you. 

My examples sound silly, but can’t you think about something during schooling or projects that stirred your emotions and imagination? **THAT’s** what you talk about.
